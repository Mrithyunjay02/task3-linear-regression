Task 3 â€“ Linear Regression

This task involved building a simple linear regression model to predict house prices using a single feature from the dataset.

What I did:
- Selected the 'GrLivArea' column to predict 'SalePrice'
- Split the dataset into training and test sets
- Trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated the model using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score
- Visualized the regression line against the actual data

Tools used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Outcome:
The model successfully learned the relationship between house size and price. The visual representation of predictions helped confirm that the model performed well.
